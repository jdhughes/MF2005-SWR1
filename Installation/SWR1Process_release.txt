o Version 1.0 09/10/2012:

This version is the initial release.

o Version 1.01.0 09/12/2012:

The SWR1 Process was modified to allow incorporation of SWR1 derivative terms 
into the groundwater flow equation solved by MODFLOW-NWT. The SWR1 Process 
was also modified to allow downstream discharge from a SFR2 reach to be routed 
to a SWR1 reach using an additional SWR1 surface-water control structure. The 
SWR1 Process was also modified to allow surface-water control structures 
discharging from the SWR1 network to discharge to SFR2 reaches.

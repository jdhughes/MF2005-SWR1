ABSTRACT 

     MODFLOW-2005 with the SWR1 Process is a version of MODFLOW-2005 (v 1.9) with
the SWR1 Process added to the boundary conditions that can be applied to the 
groundwater flow equation solved by MODFLOW-2005. The SWR1 Process uses a flexible
approach for simulating one- and two-dimensional routing of surface-water flow and
is implicitly coupled to the groundwater flow process in MODFLOW. Surface-water 
routing in SWR1 can be simulated using a diffusive-wave approximation of the 
vertically-integrated Saint-Venant equations and/or a simplified level-pool 
approach.  SWR1 can account for surface-water flow controlled by backwater 
conditions caused by small water-surface gradients or surface-water control 
structures.  A number of typical surface-water control structures can be represented, 
and it is possible to implement simple operational rules to manage surface-water 
stages and streamflow. The non-linear surface-water flow equations implemented in 
the SWR1 Process are solved using Newton methods and direct or iterative solvers.
The SWR1 Process for MODFLOW-2005 is described in the documentation report by 
Hughes and others (2012).

HISTORY

      SWR1 Process Version 1.0 09/10/2012 - Initial release. Also see the file
        ‘SWR1Process_release.txt’ for additional release notes.

      SWR1 Process Version 1.01.0 10/17/2012 - Also see the file
        ‘SWR1Process_release.txt’ for additional release notes.

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

     MODFLOW-2005 and the SWR1 Process are written in Fortran 90 programming language. 
     The code has been used on personal computers running various forms of the Microsoft
     Windows operating system.


FUNTIONALITY

     MODFLOW-2005 with the SWR1 Process can be run in three modes: (1) a surface-
     water only mode using an active SWR1 Process and an inactive groundwater
     flow process; (2) groundwater only mode (standard MODFLOW-2005); and (3)
     coupled surface-water and groundwater mode using the SWR1 Process and
     MODFLOW-2005. All standard MODFLOW-2005 packages are supported in this
     version of MODFLOW-2005. See Harbaugh (2005) for details on supported
     packages.
